## Letters from the Editors


It has taken a while to produce this issue of *Csound Journal*, but it has been worth the wait. You will notice for Issue 23 the e-journal web page templates have been completely redesigned, there are more images are included, and the text and fonts have been revised from previous issues to make for easier reading. Many thanks goes to Iain McCurdy who redesigned this Issue of *Csound Journal* and co-edited the articles.

This issue features several articles with examples, descriptions, and instructions to utilize Csound in new and interesting ways. Richard van Bemmelen includes an article on utilizing SQLite with Csound, and Anton Kholomiov writes about and documents his Haskell framework for Csound. Iain McCurdy includes an article describing Csound 30 at the National University of Ireland, Maynooth, and Brian Carty and Alan O'Sullivan describe their iOS application named Robotune. Enrico Francioni includes Part I of a series on Real-time Systems for Csound, and my own article is also included about using GLib data structures with Csound.

We hope you enjoy reading the articles, viewing the examples, and running the downloadable code examples included with Issue 23 of *Csound Journal*.
