## Letters from the Editors


Welcome to issue 20 of the Csound Journal! It is amazing to see the development of Csound and its community over the past 9 years since we started this journal. Csound continues to grow and evolve with the times, as does its users and their works. It's been a great pleasure and very inspiring for me to read this issue's articles, and I hope you'll enjoy them as much as I have.

This issue of *Csound Journal *features several interesting and very useful articles for keeping up with advances and recent developments with Csound.
