# igoto
During the i-time pass only, unconditionally transfer control to the statement labeled by _label_.

## Syntax
=== "Modern"
    ``` csound-orc
    igoto(label)
    ```

=== "Classic"
    ``` csound-orc
    igoto label
    ```

where _label_ is in the same instrument block and is not an expression.

## Examples

=== "Modern"
    Here is an example of the igoto opcode. It uses the file [igoto-modern.csd](../examples/igoto-modern.csd).
    ``` csound-csd title="Example of the igoto opcode." linenums="1"
    --8<-- "examples/igoto-modern.csd"
    ```

=== "Classic"
    Here is an example of the igoto opcode. It uses the file [igoto.csd](../examples/igoto.csd).
    ``` csound-csd title="Example of the igoto opcode." linenums="1"
    --8<-- "examples/igoto.csd"
    ```

Its output should include lines like this:

```
instr 1:  iparam = 0.000
instr 1:  ifreq = 440.000
instr 1:  iparam = 1.000
instr 1:  ifreq = 880.000
```
