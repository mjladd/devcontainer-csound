# tablegpw
Writes a table's guard point.

## Syntax
=== "Modern"
    ``` csound-orc
    tablegpw(kfn)
    ```

=== "Classic"
    ``` csound-orc
    tablegpw kfn
    ```

### Performance

_kfn_ -- Table number to be interrogated

_tablegpw_ -- For writing the table's guard point, with the value which is in location 0. Does nothing if table does not exist.

Likely to be useful after manipulating a table with [tablemix](../opcodes/tablemix.md) or [tablecopy](../opcodes/tablecopy.md).
