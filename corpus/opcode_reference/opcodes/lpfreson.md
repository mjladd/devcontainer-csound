# lpfreson

Resynthesises a signal from the data passed internally by a previous _lpread_, applying formant shifting.

## Syntax
=== "Modern"
    ``` csound-orc
    ares = lpfreson(asig, kfrqratio)
    ```

=== "Classic"
    ``` csound-orc
    ares lpfreson asig, kfrqratio
    ```

### Performance

_asig_ -- an audio driving function for resynthesis.

_kfrqratio_ -- frequency ratio. Must be greater than 0.

_lpfreson_ receives values internally produced by a leading _lpread_._lpread_ gets its values from the control file according to the input value _ktimpnt_ (in seconds). If _ktimpnt_ proceeds at the analysis rate, time-normal synthesis will result; proceeding at a faster, slower, or variable rate will result in time-warped synthesis. At each k-period, _lpread_ interpolates between adjacent frames to more accurately determine the parameter values (presented as output) and the filter coefficient settings (passed internally to a subsequent _lpreson_).

The error signal _kerr_ (between 0 and 1) derived during predictive analysis reflects the deterministic/random nature of the analyzed source. This will emerge low for pitched (periodic) material and higher for noisy material. The transition from voiced to unvoiced speech, for example, produces an error signal value of about .3. During synthesis, the error signal value can be used to determine the nature of the [lpreson](../opcodes/lpreson.md) driving function: for example, by arbitrating between pitched and non-pitched input, or even by determining a mix of the two. In normal speech resynthesis, the pitched input to [lpreson](../opcodes/lpreson.md) is a wideband periodic signal or pulse train derived from a unit such as [buzz](../opcodes/buzz.md), and the nonpitched source is usually derived from [rand](../opcodes/rand.md). However, any audio signal can be used as the driving function, the only assumption of the analysis being that it has a flat response.

_lpfreson_ is a formant shifted [lpreson](../opcodes/lpreson.md), in which _kfrqratio_ is the (cps) ratio of shifted to original formant positions. This permits synthesis in which the source object changes its apparent acoustic size. _lpfreson_ with _kfrqratio_ = 1 is equivalent to [lpreson](../opcodes/lpreson.md).

Generally, [lpreson](../opcodes/lpreson.md) provides a means whereby the time-varying content and spectral shaping of a composite audio signal can be controlled by the dynamic spectral content of another. There can be any number of _lpread/lpreson_ (or _lpfreson_) pairs in an instrument or in an orchestra; they can read from the same or different control files independently.
