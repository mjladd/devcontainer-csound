# pchmidib
Get the note number of the current MIDI event and modify it by the current pitch-bend value, express it in pitch-class units.

## Syntax

    ``` csound-orc
    ipch = pchmidib([irange])
    kpch = pchmidib([irange])
    ```

=== "Classic"

    ipch pchmidib [irange]
    kpch pchmidib [irange]
    ```

### Initialization

_irange_ (optional) -- the pitch bend range in semitones

### Performance

Get the note number of the current MIDI event, modify it by the current pitch-bend value, and express the result in pitch-class units. Available as an i-time value or as a continuous k-rate value.
