# tigoto
Transfer control at i-time when a new note is being tied onto a previously held note.

Similar to [igoto](../opcodes/igoto.md) but effective only during an i-time pass at which a new note is being &#8220;tied&#8221; onto a previously held note. (See [i Statement](../scoregens/i.md)) It does not work when a tie has not taken place. Allows an instrument to skip initialization of units according to whether a proposed tie was in fact successful. (See also [tival](../opcodes/tival.md)).

## Syntax
=== "Modern"
    ``` csound-orc
    tigoto(label)
    ```

=== "Classic"
    ``` csound-orc
    tigoto label
    ```

where _label_ is in the same instrument block and is not an expression.

## Examples

Here is an example of the tigoto opcode. It uses the file [tigoto.csd](../examples/tigoto.csd).
