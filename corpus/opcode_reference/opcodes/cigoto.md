# cigoto
During the i-time pass only, conditionally transfer control to the statement labeled by _label_.

## Syntax
=== "Modern"
    ``` csound-orc
    cigoto(condition, label)
    ```

=== "Classic"
    ``` csound-orc
    cigoto condition, label
    ```

where _label_ is in the same instrument block and is not an expression, and where _condition_ uses one of the Relational operators (_&lt;_,_ =_, _&lt;=_, _==_, _!=_) (and _=_ for convenience, see also under [Conditional Values](../control/conditional.md)).

## Examples

=== "Modern"
    Here is an example of the cigoto opcode. It uses the file [cigoto-modern.csd](../examples/cigoto-modern.csd).
    ``` csound-csd title="Example of the cigoto opcode." linenums="1"
    --8<-- "examples/cigoto-modern.csd"
    ```

=== "Classic"
    Here is an example of the cigoto opcode. It uses the file [cigoto.csd](../examples/cigoto.csd).
    ``` csound-csd title="Example of the cigoto opcode." linenums="1"
    --8<-- "examples/cigoto.csd"
    ```

Its output should include lines like:

```
instr 1:  iparam = 0.000
instr 1:  ifreq = 440.000
instr 1:  iparam = 1.000
instr 1:  ifreq = 880.000
```
