# endin
Ends the current instrument block.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
endin
```

### Initialization

Instruments can be defined in any order (but they will always be both initialized and performed in ascending instrument number order). Instrument blocks cannot be nested (i.e. one block cannot contain another).

> :memo: **Note**
>
> There may be any number of instrument blocks in an orchestra.

## Examples
