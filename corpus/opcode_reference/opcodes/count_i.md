# count_i
Get the next value from a counter.

Plugin opcode in counter.

Get the next value from a counter a init time by adding the increment and keeping the counter in the declared range.

## Syntax
=== "Modern"
    ``` csound-orc
    ival = count_i(icnt)
    ```

=== "Classic"
    ``` csound-orc
    ival count_i icnt
    ```

### Initialization

_icnt_ -- the handle of a counter object from a call to _cntCreate_.

### Performance

Calculate the next value from the counter object and return that value.

_ival_ -- returned value.

## Examples

Here is an example of the count_i opcode. It uses the file [counter.csd](../examples/counter.csd).

``` csound-csd title="Example of the count_i opcode." linenums="1"
