# vmirror
'Reflects' elements of vectorial control signals on thresholds.

## Syntax
=== "Modern"
    ``` csound-orc
    vmirror(ifn, kmin, kmax, ielements)
    ```

=== "Classic"
    ``` csound-orc
    vmirror ifn, kmin, kmax, ielements
    ```

### Initialization

_ifn_  - number of the table hosting the vector to be processed

_ielements_ - number of elements of the vector

### Performance

_kmin_  - minimum threshold value

_kmax_  - maximum threshold value

_vmirror_ 'reflects' each element of corresponding vector if it exceeds low or high thresholds.

These opcodes are similar to [limit](../opcodes/limit.md), [wrap](../opcodes/wrap.md) and [mirror](../opcodes/mirror.md), but operate with a vectorial signal instead of with a scalar signal.

Result overrides old values of _ifn1_, if these are out of min/max interval. If you want to keep input vector, use [vcopy](../opcodes/vcopy.md) opcode to copy it in another table.

All these opcodes are designed to be used together with other opcodes that operate with vectorial signals such as, [vcella](../opcodes/vcella.md), [adsynt](../opcodes/adsynt.md), [adsynt2](../opcodes/adsynt2.md) etc.
