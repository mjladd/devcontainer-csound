# cggoto
Conditionally transfer control to _label_ on every pass. (Combination of [cigoto](../opcodes/cigoto.md) and [ckgoto](../opcodes/ckgoto.md))

## Syntax
=== "Modern"
    ``` csound-orc
    cggoto(condition, label)
    ```

=== "Classic"
    ``` csound-orc
    cggoto condition, label
    ```

where _label_ is in the same instrument block and is not an expression, and where _condition_ uses one of the Relational operators (_&lt;_,_ =_, _&lt;=_, _==_, _!=_) (and _=_ for convenience, see also under [Conditional Values](../control/conditional.md)).

## Examples

=== "Modern"
    Here is an example of the cggoto opcode. It uses the file [cggoto-modern.csd](../examples/cggoto-modern.csd).
    ``` csound-csd title="Example of the cggoto opcode." linenums="1"
    --8<-- "examples/cggoto-modern.csd"
    ```

=== "Classic"
    Here is an example of the cggoto opcode. It uses the file [cggoto.csd](../examples/cggoto.csd).
    ``` csound-csd title="Example of the cggoto opcode." linenums="1"
    --8<-- "examples/cggoto.csd"
    ```
