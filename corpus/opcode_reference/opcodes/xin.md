# xin
Passes variables to a user-defined opcode block.

The _xin_ and _xout_ opcodes copy variables to and from the opcode definition, allowing communication with the calling instrument.

The types of input and output variables are defined by the parameters _intypes_ and _outtypes_.

> :memo: **Notes**
>
> * _xin_ and _xout_ should be called only once, and _xin_ should precede _xout_, otherwise an init error and deactivation of the current instrument may occur.
> * These opcodes actually run only at i-time. Performance time copying is done by the user opcode call. This means that skipping _xin_ or _xout_ with [kgoto](../opcodes/kgoto.md) has no effect, while skipping with [igoto](../opcodes/igoto.md) affects both init and performance time operation.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
xinarg1 [, xinarg2] ... [xinargN] xin
```

### Performance

_xinarg1_, _xinarg2_, ... - input arguments. The number and type of variables must agree with the user-defined opcode's _intypes_ declaration. However, _xin_ does not check for incorrect use of init-time and control-rate variables.

The syntax of a user-defined opcode block is as follows:

``` csound-orc
opcode  name, outtypes, intypes
xinarg1 [, xinarg2] [, xinarg3] ... [xinargN]  xin
[setksmps  iksmps]
... the rest of the instrument's code.
xout  xoutarg1 [, xoutarg2] [, xoutarg3] ... [xoutargN]
endop
```

The new opcode can then be used with the usual syntax:

```
[xinarg1] [, xinarg2] ... [xinargN]  name  [xoutarg1] [, xoutarg2] ... \
                                           [xoutargN] [, iksmps]
```

See the example for the [opcode](../opcodes/opcode.md) opcode.
