# rfft
Fast Fourier Transform of a real-value array.

Applies a forward Fast Fourier Transform to a real-value input
1-dimensional array. The output is another array containing the
transform, non-redundant, non-negative spectrum only.

In the case of the k-array version, the output array size will match
 the input size, with the first two points containing 0Hz and Nyquist
 frequency coefficients. This is the _packed_ output format.

The Complex-array version, on the other hand, produces an array
size that is one unit longer than the input (input size + 1 complex
numbers), containing the Nyquist frequency coefficient in
the last position of the Complex array.

Non-power-of-two transforms are limited to even sizes
with not too many factors.

## Syntax
=== "Modern"
    ``` csound-orc
    out:k[] = rfft(in:k[])
    out:Complex[] = rfft(in:k[])
    ```

=== "Classic"
    ``` csound-orc
    kout[] rfft kin[]
    out:Complex[] rfft in:k[]
    ```

### Performance

_kout[]_ -- output array containing the transform. It will be created if it does not exist.

_kin[]_ -- input array containing the real-valued input.

## Examples

Here is an example of the rfft opcode. It uses the file [rfft.csd](../examples/rfft.csd).

``` csound-csd title="Example of the rfft opcode." linenums="1"

```

Another example of the rfft opcode, now using a Complex-type array. It uses the file [rfft_complex_type.csd](../examples/rfft_complex_type.csd).
