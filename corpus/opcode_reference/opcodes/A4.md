# A4
Sets the base frequency for pitch A4.

These statements are global value [assignments](../opcodes/assign.md), made
at the beginning of an orchestra, before any instrument block is defined. Their function is to set certain [reserved symbol variables](../orch/data-types.md#constants-and-reserved-symbols) that are required for performance. Once set, these reserved symbols can be used in expressions anywhere in the orchestra.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
A4 = iarg
```

### Initialization

_A4_  = (optional) -- set reference frequency for pitch A4 to _iarg_ Hertz. The default value is 440.

In addition, any [global variable](../orch/data-types.md) can be initialized by an _init-time assignment_ anywhere before the first [instr statement](../opcodes/instr.md).  All of the above assignments are run as instrument 0 (i-pass only) at the start of real performance.

Beginning with Csound version 6.08, _A4_ may be used.  It affects the behaviour of the opcodes _cpspch_, _cpsoct_, _cps2pch_, _cpsxpch_ and _cpsmidinn_.

## Examples

=== "Modern"
    Here is an example of the A4 opcode. It uses the file [A4-modern.csd](../examples/A4-modern.csd).
    ``` csound-csd title="Example of the A4 opcode." linenums="1"
    --8<-- "examples/A4-modern.csd"
    ```

=== "Classic"
    Here is an example of the A4 opcode. It uses the file [A4.csd](../examples/A4.csd).
    ``` csound-csd title="Example of the A4 opcode." linenums="1"
    --8<-- "examples/A4.csd"
    ```
