Receives an arate array signal into an instrument through a named port.

Plugin opcode in signalflowgraph

## Syntax
=== "Modern"
    ``` csound-orc
    array = inletv(Sname)
    ```

=== "Classic"
    ``` csound-orc
    array inletv Sname
    ```

_array_ -- audio rate array inlet signal

During performance, the arate array inlet signal is received from each instance of an  instrument containing an outlet port to which this inlet has been connected using the [See also](../opcodes/connect.md)e>
