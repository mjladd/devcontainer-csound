# ihold
Causes a finite-duration note to become a &#8220;held&#8221; note.

## Syntax
=== "Modern"
    ``` csound-orc
    ihold()
    ```

=== "Classic"
    ``` csound-orc
    ihold
    ```

### Performance

_ihold_ -- this i-time statement causes a finite-duration note to become a &#8220;held&#8221; note. It thus has the same effect as a negative p3 ( see score [i Statement](../scoregens/i.md)), except that p3 here remains positive and the instrument reclassifies itself to being held indefinitely. The note can be turned off explicitly with _turnoff_, or its space taken over by another note of the same instrument number (i.e. it is tied into that note). Effective at i-time only; no-op during a _reinit_ pass.

## Examples

=== "Modern"
    Here is an example of the ihold opcode. It uses the file [ihold-modern.csd](../examples/ihold-modern.csd).
    ``` csound-csd title="Example of the ihold opcode." linenums="1"
    --8<-- "examples/ihold-modern.csd"
    ```

=== "Classic"
    Here is an example of the ihold opcode. It uses the file [ihold.csd](../examples/ihold.csd).
    ``` csound-csd title="Example of the ihold opcode." linenums="1"
    --8<-- "examples/ihold.csd"
    ```
