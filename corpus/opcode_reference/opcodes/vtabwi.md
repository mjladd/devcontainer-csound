# vtabwi
Write vectors (to tables -or arrays of vectors) at init time.

## Syntax
=== "Modern"
    ``` csound-orc
    vtabwi(indx, ifn, inarg1 [, inarg2, inarg3 , .... , inargN ])
    ```

=== "Classic"
    ``` csound-orc
    vtabwi indx, ifn, inarg1 [, inarg2, inarg3 , .... , inargN ]
    ```

### Initialization

_indx_ - Index into f-table, a positive number range matching the table length

_ifn_ - table number

_inarg1...inargN_ - input vector elements

### Performance

This opcode is useful in all cases in which one needs to write sets of values associated to unique indexes (for example, multi-channel samples, STFT bin frames, spectral formants, p-field based scores etc.). The number of elements of each vector (length of the vector) is determined by the number of optional arguments on the right (_inarg1_, _inarg2_, _inarg3_, ....  _inargN_).

Notice that no wrap nor limit mode is implemented.  So, if  an index attempt to access to a zone not allocated by the table, Csound will probably crash. However this drawback can be easily avoided by using wrap or limit opcodes applied to indexes before using _vtabwi_, in order to correct eventual out-of-range values.
