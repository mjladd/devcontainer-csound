# r2c
Real to complex format conversion.

Converts a real-valued input array in real-imaginary interleaved complex format, setting its imaginary parts to 0. The output array will be double the size of the input. This is a utility operation to facilitate complex-value operations on real arrays.

## Syntax
=== "Modern"
    ``` csound-orc
    kout[] = r2c(kin[])
    ```

=== "Classic"
    ``` csound-orc
    kout[] r2c kin[]
    ```

### Performance

_kout[]_ -- output array containing the complex-valued real-imaginary output. It will be created if it does not exist.

_kin[]_ -- input array containing the real-valued input.

## Examples

Here is an example of the r2c opcode. It uses the file [r2c.csd](../examples/r2c.csd).

``` csound-csd title="Example of the r2c opcode." linenums="1"
