# outch
Writes multi-channel audio data, with user-controllable channels, to an external device or stream.

## Syntax
=== "Modern"
    ``` csound-orc
    outch(kchan1, asig1 [, kchan2] [, asig2] [...])
    ```

=== "Classic"
    ``` csound-orc
    outch kchan1, asig1 [, kchan2] [, asig2] [...]
    ```

### Performance

_outch_ outputs _asig1_ on the channel determined by _kchan1_, _asig2_ on the channel determined by _kchan2_, etc.

> :memo: **Note**
>
> The highest number for _kchanX_ available for use with _outch_ depends on [nchnls](../opcodes/nchnls.md). If _kchanX_ is greater than _nchnls_, _asigX_ will be silent. Note that _outch_ will give a warning but not an error in this case.
