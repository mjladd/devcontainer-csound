# undersample
Sets a lower local sampling rate based on an undersampling factor.

## Syntax
=== "Modern"
    ``` csound-orc
    undersample(ifactor [,icvt_in, icvt_out])
    ```

=== "Classic"
    ``` csound-orc
    undersample ifactor [,icvt_in, icvt_out]
    ```

### Initialization

_ifactor_ -- sets the undersampling factor. It needs to be a positive integer &gt; 1. A factor of 1 is a non-op, zero or negative factors are illegal. The local sampling rate is set as (1/ifactor) * sr. The value of the sr variable is then changed locally. Local ksmps is also changed accordingly.

_icvt_in_ -- converter used for input: if Secret Rabbit Code is used, then 0 - best quality sync (default); 1 - medium quality sync; 2 - fast sync; 3 - zero-order hold; and  4 - linear.

_icvt_out_ -- converter used for output, defaults to the input converter, but can be different.

> :memo: **Note**
>
> Higher-quality sync converters add a small amount of latency to the signal (0, 1, 2, increasing with quality). Converters 3 and 4 are latency-free.
>
> Calling this opcode in the same UDO as setksmps is not allowed. The opcode can only be used in UDOs. Audio or control rate array arguments are not allowed. Global variables or bus channels should not be used.
