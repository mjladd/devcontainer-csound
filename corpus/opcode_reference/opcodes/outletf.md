Sends a frate signal (fsig) out from an instrument to a named port.

Plugin opcode in signalflowgraph

## Syntax
=== "Modern"
    ``` csound-orc
    outletf(Sname, fsignal)
    ```

=== "Classic"
    ``` csound-orc
    outletf Sname, fsignal
    ```

_fsignal_ -- frate output signal (fsig)

During performance, the output signal is sent to each instance of an instrument containing an inlet port to which this outlet has been connected using the [See also](../opcodes/connect.md)e>
