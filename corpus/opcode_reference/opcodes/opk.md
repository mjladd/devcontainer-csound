# k
Converts a i-rate parameter to an k-rate value or an a-rate value to a k-rate value by down-sampling.

For example to be used with [rnd()](../opcodes/rnd.md) and [birnd()](../opcodes/birnd.md) to generate random numbers at k-rate.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
k(x) (i-rate args only)
k(x) (a-rate args only)
```

where the argument within the parentheses may be an expression. Value converters perform arithmetic translation from units of one kind to units of another. The result can then be a term in a further expression.
