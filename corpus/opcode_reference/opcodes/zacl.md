# zacl
Clears one or more variables in the za space.

## Syntax
=== "Modern"
    ``` csound-orc
    zacl(kfirst [, klast])
    ```

=== "Classic"
    ``` csound-orc
    zacl kfirst [, klast]
    ```

### Performance

_kfirst_ -- first za location in the range to clear.

_klast_ -- last za location in the range to clear. If not given, only _kfirst_ location is cleared

_zacl_ clears one or more variables in the za space. This is useful for those variables which are used as accumulators for mixing a-rate signals at each cycle, but which must be cleared before the next set of calculations.

## Examples

Here is an example of the zacl opcode. It uses the file [zacl.csd](../examples/zacl.csd).
